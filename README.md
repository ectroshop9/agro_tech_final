AGRO_TECH 2026: Multi-Source Med-Gemma Framework
Integrating Satellite, Drone Telemetry & Clinical Real-time Data
📖 Executive Summary
AGRO_TECH 2026 is a sovereign AI framework developed for the Ouargla Province (Algeria). It addresses the critical nexus between environmental degradation (soil/water salinity) and public health (renal diseases). By leveraging Google's Gemma 2 2b-it model and LanceDB, the system correlates high-resolution drone telemetry with clinical datasets to provide proactive medical and agricultural interventions.

🚀 Technical Core Pillars
Large Language Model: Gemma 2 2b-it (Optimized for medical-environmental reasoning).

Vector Database: LanceDB (Managing high-dimensional geospatial and clinical vectors).

Efficiency: 4-bit Quantization (BitsAndBytes) for high-performance inference on edge-constrained environments (Kaggle T4 GPUs).

Inference Strategy: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to ensure ground-truth accuracy using local data from Ouargla.

🛠️ System Architecture & Data Fusion
The framework integrates three distinct data layers:

Satellite Layer (NDVI): Monitoring vegetation stress and date palm health via multispectral indices.

Drone Layer (Telemetry): Real-time ground truth for Electrical Conductivity (EC) and water mineralization.

Clinical Layer (Medical Records): Statistical tracking of Renal Calculi (kidney stones) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence in affected sectors like Said Otba and Hassi Ben Abdallah.

🗺️ Project Roadmap
Phase 1: Engine Initialization & Quantization
Connecting to Gemma 2 weights via the Transformers API.

Implementing NF4 quantization to maximize VRAM efficiency.

Phase 2: Vector Brain Construction (LanceDB)
Ingestion of Ouargla’s regional datasets (2006 historical vs 2026 real-time).

Embedding generation for geographic coordinates and soil chemistry.

Phase 3: The Impact Lab (Multi-Source Reasoning)
Developing the logic to correlate water salinity spikes with clinical patient surges.

Generating actionable "One Health" strategic reports.

Phase 4: Edge Deployment & Assets Export
Exporting model assets (ONNX/MediaPipe) for integration into Drones and Android Mobile Apps.

Offline inference capability for field workers in remote desert areas.

📈 Tangible Impact (The "One Health" Approach)
For Agriculture: Predictive alerts for date palm salt-stress, increasing yield by up to 25%.

For Healthcare: Pre-emptive identification of renal disease hotspots, enabling targeted water filtration deployment.

For Governance: A data-driven decision-support system for regional sustainability.

🛠 Installation & Usage (Kaggle Environment)
Python

# Initialize the AGRO_TECH Engine
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig
import lancedb

# Load quantized Gemma 2 2b-it
quant_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("/kaggle/input/gemma-2/transformers/gemma-2-2b-it/2", quantization_config=quant_config)

# Connect to the Vector Knowledge Base
db = lancedb.connect("./agro_tech_vectors")
table = db.open_table("real_time_monitoring")
🥇 Visionary Statement
"AGRO_TECH 2026 is not just a codebase; it is a digital safeguard for the environment and the people of the Sahara, turning data into life-saving intelligence."
